Feature: Posting
   In order to express my views
   As a user
   I want to be able to post entries into the guestbook

@post

   Given I am on the guestbook page
   Then I should see a button labelled "Post a New Entry"
   When I click the button labelled "Post a New Entry"
   Then I am on the posting page

@post

   Given I am on the posting page
   Then I should see a field labelled "Your name"
    And I should see a field labelled "Your comment"

@post
Scenario: Posting a valid entry
   Given I am on the posting page
     And I have filled out the form as follows
       | Label          | Value             |
       | Your name      | Jakob             |
       | Your comment   | Das ist gut!      |
   When I click the button labelled "Post"
   Then I should be on the guestbook page
    And I see the flash message "Thanks for posting!"
    And the guestbook entries includes the following
       | Name      | Comment      | Posted date          |
