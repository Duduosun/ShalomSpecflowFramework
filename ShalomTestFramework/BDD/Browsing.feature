Feature: Browsing
   In order to see who's been on the site
   As a user
   I want to be able to view the list of posts

@browse
Scenario: Navigation to homepage
   When I navigate to /Guestbook
   Then I should be on the guestbook page

@browse
Scenario: Viewing existing entries
   Given I am on the guestbook page
   Then I should see a list of guestbook entries
    And guestbook entries have an author
    And guestbook entries have a posted date
    And guestbook entries have a comment
